Implemented a foundational encryption algorithm called the Feistel block cipher that modern cryptography systems are based on, using the Java programming language. Featuring key scheduling, XOR operations, permutations, and S-box substitutions to simulate DES/AES-style encryption. Collaborated with Neils Weisbeek.
